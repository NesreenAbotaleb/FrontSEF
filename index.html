                        <p>The Milky Way is the <sapn>galaxy</sapn> that includes Earth, the Sun, and billions of other stars. <br>
                            
                            It looks like a <span>spinning disk</span> with a bright band of stars when seen from Earth. <br>

                            Our solar system is located in one of the Milky Way's spiral arms. <br>

                            <span>Fun Fact:</span>  If you look up at the night sky on a clear night, you can see the Milky Way as a fuzzy band of light!

                            It's much bigger than the Milky Way, with about a <span>trillion</span> stars! <br>

                            <span> Fact: </span>Andromeda is moving towards us, and in 4 billion years, it will collide with the Milky Way! <br>

                            Caelus is often compared to the Greek figure Uranus <br>

                           <span> Fun Fact: </span> His name is related to the Latin word for “sky.”

                        <p>A black hole is a place in space where gravity is so strong that nothing,

                            <span>Horizon: </span>The “point of no return.” Once something crosses it, it can't escape. <br>

                            <span>Singularity:</span>  The center of a black hole where everything is squished into a tiny point. <br>

                            <span>Accretion Disk: </span> A spinning ring of hot gas and dust around the black hole. <br>

                            <span> Stellar: </span>Made when a big star dies. <br>

                        <p>A magnetar is a type of <span>neutron star</span> with an incredibly strong magnetic field. <br>
                            
                            Neutron stars are leftover cores from massive stars that have exploded. <br>

                            <span>Magnetars have magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's!</span> <br>

                            They can create huge bursts of energy, including<span> X-rays</span> and <span>gamma rays</span>.

                            It’s powered by a <span> black hole </span>at its center, pulling in lots of gas and dust.<br>

                            Quasars give off <span>huge amounts of energy and light</span>, including radio waves and X-rays.<br>

                            <span>Fun Fact:</span> Quasars are so far away that we’re seeing them as they were billions of years ago!

                            It orbits around Earth and <span>shines at night</span> because it reflects the Sun’s light.<br>
                            <span>Phases: </span>The Moon goes through different shapes (like full moon, half moon) because of its

                            <span>Fun Fact:</span> The Moon has craters from space rocks hitting it,
